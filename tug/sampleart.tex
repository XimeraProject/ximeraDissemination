\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Please write an abstract. Please use only standard \LaTeX\ and \TUB\
macros in the abstract, not article-specific abbreviations or other
macros; that helps us make the web pages.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

This is an example article for \TUB, linked from
\url{https://tug.org/TUGboat/location.html}.

\section{Basic packages and hyperlinks}

The standard \texttt{graphicx} and \texttt{xcolor} packages work fine
for image and color handling, respectively, as does the
\texttt{hyperref} package for active urls. \TUB\ is produced using
\acro{PDF} files exclusively, but conversion from \DVI\ is fine and supported.

Please use the standard \cs{url} command for urls:
\begin{verbatim}
\url{https://some/url} % yes
\end{verbatim}
For \TUB, we prefer not to print the `\texttt{https://}', but to include
the protocol in other cases, so we usually do \verb|\def\url{\tburl}|,
which takes care of that, while keeping the source using the standard
\cs{url} command.

In any case, please do \emph{not} hide hyperlinks via \cs{href}, as in:
\begin{verbatim}
\href{https://some/url}{some text} % no!
\end{verbatim}
When printed on paper, the url will not be visible and readers will
not know it exists.

\section{Abbreviation macros and typing}

The \texttt{ltugboat} class provides many abbreviation commands; here
are a few of the most common:

% verbatim blocks are often better in \small
\begin{verbatim}[\small]
\AllTeX \AMS \BibTeX \Cplusplus \CTAN \DVI
\HTML \LaTeXe \macOS \MathML \MF \PDF \PS
\TUB \TUG \tug \WEB \XeLaTeX \XeTeX \XML
\end{verbatim}

A few other typing conventions:

\begin{itemize}
\item For an em-dash with our spacing (preferred to \verb|---|):
\cs{Dash}, with output\Dash like this.

\item For initialisms in all caps:
\verb|\acro{FRED}|,\\ with output: \acro{FRED}.

\item A literal control sequence:
\verb|\cs{fred}|,\\ with output: \cs{fred}.

\item A syntactic metavariable:
\verb|\meta{fred}|,\\ with output: \meta{fred}.

\item A title:
\verb|\titleref{Book of Fred}|,\\ with output: \titleref{Book of Fred}.
\end{itemize}

We recommend using \cs{begin}\tubbraced{verbatim}\texttt{[\small] ...}
\cs{end}\tubbraced{verbatim} for code blocks, since we prefer not to
colorize code when printed. But if you want to have some font changes,
our recommended settings for the \texttt{listings} package are in the
\texttt{ltubguid} manual mentioned below.

Please put punctuation outside quotes, ``like this'', unless the
punctuation is actually part of the quoted material.

Also, please put punctuation after footnotes.

\section{Figures}

For \TUB, the standard \texttt{figure} environment produces a
column-width figure; this is desirable when at all possible. The
\texttt{figure*} environment produces a full-width (across both columns)
figure when needed. Analogously for \texttt{table} and \texttt{table*}.

Please put captions below figures, but above tables.

Don't worry overmuch about figure placements, as they will likely change
with editing.

\begin{figure}
This is a column-width figure, made with \\
\cs{begin}\tubbraced{figure}. Use \tubbraced{figure*} for a full-width
(double-column) figure.
%
\caption{Caption for column-width figure.}
\label{fig.example}
\end{figure}

%\begin{figure*}
%A full-width figure, made with \cs{begin}\tubbraced{figure*}.
%\caption{Caption for full-width figure.}
%\label{fig.fullwidth}
%\end{figure*}

\section{References}

For references to other issues of \TUB, please use the format
\textsl{volno}:\textsl{issno}, e.g., ``\TUB\ 32:1''.

The primary \TUB\ style documentation is the \texttt{ltubguid} manual,
available online at \tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/tugboat} or locally with
\texttt{texdoc tugboat}. For general \CTAN\ package references, we
recommend that form, using \texttt{/pkg/}. If you need to refer to a
specific file on \CTAN, use:\\
\texttt{https://mirror.ctan.org/\textsl{path}}

We recommend using \BibTeX\ (but don't require it), with the
\texttt{tugboat} \BibTeX\ style. The \texttt{biblio} directory on \CTAN,
\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/biblio}, provides files \texttt{tugboat.bib} with a
complete bibliography of \TUB, \texttt{texbook3.bib} with many common
\TeX-related books and articles, and plenty more.

Email \verb|tugboat@tug.org| with any questions.

\bibliographystyle{tugboat} % tugboat's bibtex style
\nocite{book-minimal}       % make the example bibliography non-empty
\bibliography{xampl}        % xampl.bib comes with bibtex
