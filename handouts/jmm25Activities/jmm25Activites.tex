\lettrine[lines=2]{X}{imera} had a remarkable presence at the \textit{Joint
    Mathematics Meetings 2025}, drawing considerable interest from attendees.
Strategically located in the exhibit hall, our booth became a key attraction.
During the conference, we demonstrated Ximera's features and discussed our
upcoming initiatives. Five dedicated members of the Ximera team were present:
Jim Fowler, Tae Eun Kim, Jeff Kuan, Bart Snapp, and Paul Zachlin.

    {\textbf{The Ximera booth}} operated during the following hours: Wednesday
    6:00pm--8:00pm, Thursday 9am--5pm, Friday 9am--5pm, and Saturday 9am--noon.
    Positioned in a corner just behind our proprietary competitors, our booth
    captured attention
    with a dynamic slideshow on a 100-inch screen.

    A computer monitor on the table displayed a video showcasing Ximera in
    action. We also featured bound demonstration copies of our calculus texts
    and
    \textit{Linear Algebra: An Interactive Approach} by Anna Davis and Paul
    Zachlin.

    {\bf New connections} were formed! We distributed approximately 60
    Ximera T-shirts, 70 User Manuals, 50 TechBriefs, and added 54 emails to our
    mailing list. Several attendees expressed interest in converting their
    existing
    \LaTeX\ content into Ximera, paving the way for potential collaborations.

    If you'd like Ximera T-shirts (more are on the way!) or stickers, please
    let us know, and we will
    fulfill your order with care. You can find the Ximera User Manual here:

    \textbf{Presentations featuring Ximera}
    On Saturday, Paul Zachlin delivered a talk titled \textit{Enhancing our
        Linear
        Algebra OER with Additional Features}.

    The presentation introduced the book (co-authored with Anna Davis)
    \begin{center}
    \texttt{https://sites.google.com/view/lin-alg-interactive-intro/home}
    \end{center}
    and highlighted new additions such as
    an Octave Tutorial and Review Exercises. Future plans for online resources,
    including those for a differential equations course, were also discussed.
    Approximately 20 participants attended this session.
