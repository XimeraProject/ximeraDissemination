\lettrine[lines=2]{X}{imera} had a strong presence at MathFest 2024 and drew
much attention.

With a booth in the exhibit hall and two presentations were given featuring
Ximera.

We worked on documenting the deploy process and there was much planning for the
future of Ximera.

In all, we had 8 people working with Ximera

    \textbf{Presentations featuring Ximera} were popular talks, and played to a
    full house.
    On Tuesday, Anna Davis presented a wonderful Math Circle activity
    \textit{Lines of Sight} authored in Ximera.
    In this activity young mathematicians are shown pictures of railroad tracks
    and then asked a number of questions ranging from the simple to the seemingly
    impossible. We won't spoil it, but at the end, there's definitely an \textit{Ah-ha! Math Moment}.

%% WIM and graphics /preamble

Our booth was in a prime location, visible from the entrance to the exhibit
hall.
Participants were drawn in by a vibrant slide show, displayed on a 100 inch
screen.
Once closer, a monitor was used to display a video showing Ximera in action.
On the table we had hard copies of our calculus text and Anna Davis Paul
Zachlin's Linear Algebra text.
The stickers were a hit.
Please contact us if you would like Ximera stickers and I will fill your order
with some degree of accuracy.
We currently have:

Combined, the presentations had an audience of around 100 participants, with
around 50 at anna's talk and 40 at Fowler/Snapp.
Both rooms were packed.

    \textbf{Funding for the Ximera Project} is provided by
    a U.S.\ Department of Education Open Textbooks Pilot Program grant in the
    amount of \$2,125,000, from 2024--2026, with no external funding. In the
    past, the Ximera Project has
    also received support from NSF Grant DUE-1245433, the Shuttleworth
    Foundation, the Ohio State University
    Department of Mathematics, and the Affordable Learning Exchange at OSU.
