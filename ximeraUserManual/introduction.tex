\maketitle

Ximera, pronounced ``chimera,'' (\textbf{X}imera: \textbf{I}nteractive,
\textbf{M}athematics, \textbf{E}ducation,
\textbf{R}esources, for \textbf{A}ll) is an open-source platform that provides
tools for
authoring and publishing (PDF and Online), open-source, interactive educational
content, such as textbooks, assessments, and online courses.

\paragraph{Authors}  write and store their content on their own
machines and GitHub repositories.
Authors own their content and decide how to license their content. From a
single source written in \LaTeX, Ximera generates various output: PDF
worksheets,
PDF textbooks, and	PDF solution manuals, and so on. Of most interest,
Ximera can
also create online interactive activities:

The source code used to produce PDFs can also create interactive online
activities when deployed to a Ximera server. Students access this content via a
URL or an assignment in their LMS.

\paragraph{Get involved} by contributing as an instructor, author,
or developer. To get started with Ximera, visit our
\textit{First Steps in Ximera} GitHub repository:

\textbf{This document assumes you have completed the instructions there, and have
successively deployed Ximera content online.}

\paragraph{Funding for the Ximera Project} is provided by
a U.S.\ Department of Education Open Textbooks Pilot Program grant in the
amount of \$2,125,000, from 2024--2026, with no external funding.
In the past, the Ximera Project has
also received support from NSF Grant DUE-1245433, the Shuttleworth
Foundation, the Ohio State University
Department of Mathematics, and the Affordable Learning Exchange at OSU.


As a token of our appreciation, \textbf{consider applying for a Ximera
    Flash-Grant Stipend:}
